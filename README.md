# Motorph Application Setup Guide

## Prerequisites

Before accessing the application, ensure you have the following installed:

1. **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)** (Includes npm)
2. **[npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) or [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)**
3. **[Java Coding Pack for VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/java)**
4. **Visual Studio Code (VSCode) (Optional, but recommended)**
   - If you can run Java in another IDE while using VSCode for the frontend, you may skip this, but VSCode is preferred for consistency.

## Cloning the Repository

Once you have installed the prerequisites, clone this repository to your machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Morfusee/MO-IT110-OOP.git
```

For more details on cloning a repository, check [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository).

## Running the Frontend

1. Open the project folder in **VSCode**.
2. Open the terminal:
   - Press `Ctrl + J` to open the terminal.
3. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   
   ```sh
   cd frontend
   ```
4. Install the packages for the frontend
   ```sh
   npm install  # If using npm
   ```
   
   ```sh
   pnpm install  # If using pnpm
   ```
6. After installing the packages, start the frontend server:
   
   ```sh
   npm run dev  # If using npm
   ```
   
   ```sh
   pnpm run dev  # If using pnpm
   ```
7. The frontend server will start and provide a URL where you can access the application.

## Running the Backend

There are two ways to start the backend server:

### **Option 1: Using Another IDE**

If you prefer another Java-supported IDE, you can run the backend from there and then access the frontend normally.

### **Option 2: Using VSCode (Recommended)**

1. Open **VSCode**, which will initialize the Java SDK.

2. Wait until the Java SDK is fully loaded (indicated at the bottom of the VSCode window).

3. Click on any Java file, and a **Run** button should appear beside your open files.

## Logging into the Application

### Once both servers are running:

- Open the provided frontend URL in your browser.
- The **HR Employee's credentials** will be provided automatically.
- Use those credentials to log in and access the system.

### Logging in as an Employee

- Navigate to the **Backend folder** of the repository.
- Open the **src/main/resources directory** and locate **LoginCredentials.json**.
- Select an employee from the list and use the provided credentials to log in.

## Notes

- If you encounter errors, ensure all dependencies are installed properly.
- If Java SDK is not detected in VSCode, try restarting the editor and checking the extensions.
- If you need additional support, refer to the official documentation links provided in this guide.

### If you've tried everything after setting things up for Java, try doing the following:
1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + P`.
2. Search for **Java: Clean Java Language Server Workspace**. Click it.
